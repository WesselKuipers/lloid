*** MUST SOLVE BEFORE TAKING TO PROD ***
/ dodo codes not updating
/ unreacting from any message dequeues you
? double-queuing seems to still work

*** FEATURES THAT CAN BE ADDED LATER ***
remove stale entries from recently_departed list when market closes.
/ check size of queue and time left in queue
5 minute warning
/ let lloid pin/unpin messages - can't test, no permissions
Let host pause to unclog
Let host let next person in
/ manually let the next person in
/ private message should confirm whose code you received
/ no error message if you queue up while still in line
/ unqueue yourself by unreacting
report a listing as closed -- MAYBE. Can be abused
when closing your market, post should be edited to reflect
/only use bot's reactions
/ negative wait time estimate
[A-HJ-NP-Y0-9]{5} - validate dodo codes
refactor

*** FEEDBACK FROM Discord/IRC ***
i recommend setting up sentry as well for easier logging
