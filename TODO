*** MUST SOLVE BEFORE TAKING TO PROD ***
/ dodo codes not updating
/ unreacting from any message dequeues you
/ double-queuing seems to still work

Fix bug where trying to update your dodo code instead creates a new listing

*** FEATURES THAT CAN BE ADDED LATER ***
/ make !queueinfo work in pms
/ estimated time should be in minutes
/ Let host pause to unclog
/ Let host let next person in
have lloid announce if they're going down for maintenance
remove stale entries from recently_departed list when market closes.
5 minute warning

allow bot to be on multiple discord servers
refactor
report a listing as closed -- MAYBE. Can be abused

/ check size of queue and time left in queue
/ let lloid pin/unpin messages - can't test, no permissions
/ manually let the next person in
/ private message should confirm whose code you received
/ no error message if you queue up while still in line
/ unqueue yourself by unreacting
/ when closing your market, post should be edited to reflect
/only use bot's reactions
/ negative wait time estimate
/ [A-HJ-NP-Y0-9]{5} - validate dodo codes

*** FEEDBACK FROM Discord/IRC ***
i recommend setting up sentry as well for easier logging
